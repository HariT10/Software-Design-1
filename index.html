  <h1>What is the software development process?</h1>
  
  <p>The software development process consists of many different stages. These many different stages are used to ensure 
    that the final product is of the highest quality. The different stages are requirement gathering, planning and design, 
    implementation and coding, the testing phase, and lastly, maintenance. The “requirement gathering” stage is when you ask 
    lots of questions to get a clear understanding of how the client wants the program. The “planning/design” stage is where 
    you would use all the gathered requirements from the previous step to create a project/game plan. This is also the step 
    where you would plan/design the input, output, and algorithm to solve the problem. The “implementation/coding” stage is 
    where you would program the software using the resources that you have gathered/designed. The “testing phase” is where 
    the developer would do some test cases on the program to improve its quality. Finally, the “maintenance” stage is where 
    you keep the program in perfect condition by doing updates, bug fixes, and making minor improvements that might be suggested 
    by the user.</p>

  
  <h1>Why is software design important?</h1>
  
  <p>Software design is important because it creates a roadmap for solving the problem at hand and helps developers build 
    quality software. It makes the whole task easier as it separates it into different parts. It also helps if there is a 
    big team, each team member will understand their role. Software design also makes sure that the program will run well, 
    be easy to maintain, and be easier to grow.</p>

 

   <h1>Give an example of a software that you personally used that you think was
      designed well and explain why.</h1>

  <p>The software I personally use and that is designed well is YouTube. I think YouTube is designed well just because of 
    how simple everything is setup on both desktops and the app on phones. It can be used to watch videos for fun, learn 
    new things, or even study for school. It is very easy to search for content, view your subscriptions, and browse through 
    videos. YouTube’s search and recommendation algorithms also make the software very user-friendly. If you want to search 
    for something, it will show recommendations of what you might want to search for. Also, when you watch a video to learn 
    something new, the YouTube algorithm will recommend more videos related to that concept on the side or on the home page. 
    This feature has helped me many times in studying for classes or just learning something in general.</p>

  <h1>1.	Write a short paragraph (up to 200 words) to summarize what is happening in the requirements gathering stage and 
    explain why this stage is important for the entire software development process.</h1>
  
  <p>The software development process consists of many different stages. These many different stages are used to ensure 
    that the final product is of the highest quality. The different stages are requirement gathering, planning and design, 
    implementation and coding, the testing phase, and lastly, maintenance. The “requirement gathering” stage is when you ask

  <h1>Write 5 user stories for that software. (Recall the user story template: As a <'user type'>, I want <'some action/function'>, 
    so that <'some reason'> )</h1>
  
  <p>

    1)	As a student, I want a search bar to search up videos, so that I can watch videos on topics I learn at school to help me understand better.
  <p>

  <p>
    2)	As a video creator, I want an option to upload videos, so that I can show my passion and skill in video recording.
  <p>

  <p>
    3)	As a programmer, I want an option to save videos in “Watch Later” or “History”, so that if I’m watching a video to learn a language 
    like Java, I can keep coming back to the video. 
  <p>

  <p>
    4)	As a kid, I want an option for all my subscribed channels to show up on one page called “Subscriptions”, so that I can easily see when my favourite creator uploads. 
  <p>

  <p>
    5)	As a person who has a job, I want an option to download an app, so that I can watch videos during my work break.
