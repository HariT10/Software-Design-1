  <h1>What is the software development process?</h1>
  
  <p>The software development process consists of many different stages. These many different stages are used to ensure 
    that the final product is of the highest quality. The different stages are requirement gathering, planning and design, 
    implementation and coding, the testing phase, and lastly, maintenance. The “requirement gathering” stage is when you ask 
    lots of questions to get a clear understanding of how the client wants the program. The “planning/design” stage is where 
    you would use all the gathered requirements from the previous step to create a project/game plan. This is also the step 
    where you would plan/design the input, output, and algorithm to solve the problem. The “implementation/coding” stage is 
    where you would program the software using the resources that you have gathered/designed. The “testing phase” is where 
    the developer would do some test cases on the program to improve its quality. Finally, the “maintenance” stage is where 
    you keep the program in perfect condition by doing updates, bug fixes, and making minor improvements that might be suggested 
    by the user.</p>

  
  <h1>Why is software design important?</h1>
  
  <p>Software design is important because it creates a roadmap for solving the problem at hand and helps developers build 
    quality software. It makes the whole task easier as it separates it into different parts. It also helps if there is a 
    big team, each team member will understand their role. Software design also makes sure that the program will run well, 
    be easy to maintain, and be easier to grow.</p>

 

   <h1>Give an example of a software that you personally used that you think was
      designed well and explain why.</h1>

  <p>The software I personally use and that is designed well is YouTube. I think YouTube is designed well just because of 
    how simple everything is setup on both desktops and the app on phones. It can be used to watch videos for fun, learn 
    new things, or even study for school. It is very easy to search for content, view your subscriptions, and browse through 
    videos. YouTube’s search and recommendation algorithms also make the software very user-friendly. If you want to search 
    for something, it will show recommendations of what you might want to search for. Also, when you watch a video to learn 
    something new, the YouTube algorithm will recommend more videos related to that concept on the side or on the home page. 
    This feature has helped me many times in studying for classes or just learning something in general.</p>

  <h1>1.	Write a short paragraph (up to 200 words) to summarize what is happening in the requirements gathering stage and 
    explain why this stage is important for the entire software development process.</h1>
  
  <p>The requirement’s gathering stage is at the start of any software development process.  This is the stage where the developers 
    ask questions to figure out what the clients want in the software. As a team, you would write out the requirements that need to 
    be in the software. Good requirements define the users, user terms, are categorized, prioritized, and flow logically. A good requirement 
    example is “The software must run under Windows OS”. This is good because it specifically says the type of OS. A bad requirement example 
    is “The software must run on our existing operating system”. This is bad because it doesn’t say the type of operating system. This stage 
    is important for the entire software development process because it lays the basic foundations of what the entire project needs. Without 
    a requirement gathering stage, it is more likely that you will face problems during the software development process.</p>

  
  <h1>Write 5 user stories for that software. (Recall the user story template: As a <'user type'>, I want <'some action/function'>, 
    so that <'some reason'> )</h1>
  
  <p>

    1)	As a student, I want a search bar to search up videos, so that I can watch videos on topics I learn at school to help me understand better.
  <p>

  <p>
    2)	As a video creator, I want an option to upload videos, so that I can show my passion and skill in video recording.
  <p>

  <p>
    3)	As a programmer, I want an option to save videos in “Watch Later” or “History”, so that if I’m watching a video to learn a language 
    like Java, I can keep coming back to the video. 
  <p>

  <p>
    4)	As a kid, I want an option for all my subscribed channels to show up on one page called “Subscriptions”, so that I can easily see when my favourite creator uploads. 
  <p>

  <p>
    5)	As a person who has a job, I want an option to download an app, so that I can watch videos during my work break.

  <h1> Describe the Elements of Empathy </h1>
  
  <p> Empathy is the way of understanding and respecting others’ feelings, thoughts, and ways of life. The different 
    elements of empathy are respect, understanding user experiences, a non-judgmental perspective, etc. </p>

      
  
  <h1>"Consumers, Literally" - Model 1</h1>
  
  <p> The three business models I picked are “Consumers, Literally”, “Sheep”, and “Human Factor”. Firstly, the problem 
    with the “Consumers, Literally” model is that it views people as means of profit. A long-time internet industry analyst, 
    Jerry Michalski, states that “businesses began to see a consumer as really no more than a gullet whose only purpose in life 
    is to gulp products and crap cash”. Viewing customers this way is an explicit barrier to developing empathy for customers and 
    users. This business model lacks respect, which is an element of empathy. This is because it does not view people as humans 
    but rather as profit-making machines. Empathy requires respect and a connection between the consumer and seller, rather 
    than just viewing customers as "profit makers". </p>

 
  <h1> "Sheep" - Model 2</h1>

  <p> Secondly, the problem with the “Sheep” model is that it is disrespectful to the people. Views customers as nothing but 
    consumers and does not account for their feelings or experiences. This business model lacks the elements of empathy of 
    respect and a non-judgmental perspective. This is because of the name “Sheep”, it sees everyone as similar when that’s 
    not the case. Everyone is diverse and intelligent in different ways. </p>


  <h1> "Human Factor" - Model 3</h1>

  <p> Lastly, the problem with the “Human Factor” model is that it portrays people as knowing exactly what they want to achieve 
    and following specific steps to get to their goals. The problem with this is that it does not show the bigger picture of 
    human behavior. The element of empathy this model lacks is understanding the user's experiences and feelings. This is because 
    this model focuses on goals and steps but not human emotions, feelings, and experiences. </p>

  <h1> Significance of Paper Prototyping </h1>
  
  <p> Prototyping in software design is creating a plan or mock-up design of the software application before it is developed. 
    It is significant in the development process because it gives you a clear view of your software. The reasons why prototyping 
    exists is to try out different designs, demonstrate concepts, and validate requirements. The more feedback designers get on 
    their prototype, the more customers will like the final product. A quote from class by Donald A. Norman states that “designers 
    know too much about their product to be objective judges”. This is important because, by showing more people, you can get better 
    feedback from people other than the designers. Doing this will also make sure that there is more of a connection between the 
    team.</p>

 
  <h1> 3 Key Benefit's</h1>

  <p> The first key benefit of using prototyping in software development is feedback. Feedback is very important in improving 
    the design of the final product. The second key benefit is that it encourages creativity. It encourages the team to get 
    creative by making lots of different designs. The last key benefit is that it reduces development costs. This is because 
    finding flaws in the prototyping stage saves more time and money than finding them in the development stage.</p>


  <h1> Basic Steps in Creating Paper Prototype </h1>

  <p> The first step in creating a paper prototype is to choose the most important user. This step is to identify the user 
    or user persona. The second step is to determine some typical tasks. This step is to identify the tasks the users are 
    supposed to perform when using the given software. The third step is to make screen shots or sketches. This step is to 
    create different screen shots/sketches of the software; each screen has a different functionality. The fourth step is to 
    perform usability tests. This is where you would have participants test your paper prototypes, navigate through different 
    screen shots, and give feedback.</p>
